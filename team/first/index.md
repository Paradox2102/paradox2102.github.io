## FLL

####[grades 4-8]

FLL introduces elementary and middle school students to the challenges of real world engineering by having them build a LEGO Mindstorm robot and program the robot to complete tasks, with help from their coaches. Students learn team-building, presentation skills and how to apply math and science concepts to real world problems which all contribute to understanding how to make positive contributions to their community.

FTC includes teams of students in middle school and high school who design, build and program robots, that fit within a 18in cube, to compete in challenges against other teams. Students are given the opportunity to learn real world skills such as problem solving, team-building and learning to apply math and science to real world problems. Students compete for a chance to attend the world championships. Participating students can also apply for 13.5 million dollars worth of college scholarships.

## FRC

#### [grades 9-12]

FRC includes teams of students who design and build robots 120 lbs in 6 weeks, with the help of their mentors.
