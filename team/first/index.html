        <h4>Grades K-3</h4>
        <p>
          Jr.FLL introduces children to real-world problems each year through a theme oriented Challenge. While exploring this 
          theme teams create simple machines with LEGO elements that include a motorized part as well as present the information 
          theyâ€™ve uncovered in a Show Me Poster. All these activities are guided by the Jr. FLL Core Values that include 
          teamwork, respect and critical thinking.

        <h4>Grades 4-8</h4>
        <p>
          FLL introduces elementary and middle school students to the challenges of real world engineering by having them build a 
          LEGO Mindstorm robot and program the robot to complete tasks, with help from their coaches. Students learn team-building, 
          presentation skills and how to apply math and science concepts to real world problems which all contribute to understanding 
          how to make positive contributions to their community. Learn more under our FLL tab.

        <p>
          FTC includes teams of students in middle school and high school who design, build and program robots, that fit within a 
          18in cube, to compete in challenges against other teams. Students are given the opportunity to learn real world skills 
          such as problem solving, team-building and learning to apply math and science to real world problems. Students compete 
          for a chance to attend the world championships. Participating students can also apply for 13.5 million dollars worth 
          of college scholarships.

        <h4>Grades 9-12</h4>
        <p>
          FRC includes teams of students who design and build robots 120 lbs in 6 weeks, with the help of their mentors. In order to 
          build their robots, teams are responsible for finding sponsors and applying for grants as well as collecting donations. 
          At competitions, the teams put their robots to the test in competition matches and also compete for numerous awards based 
          on the workings of their team and how they have spread the word or FIRST into the community. Team members are also given 
          the opportunity to receive college scholarships in upwards of 30 million dollars (collectively).
