           Jr. FLL introduces children to real-world problems each year through a theme oriented Challenge. While exploring this theme teams create simple machines with LEGO elements that include a motorized part as well as present the information theyâ€™ve uncovered in a Show Me Poster. All these activities are guided by the Jr. FLL Core Values that include teamwork, respect and critical thinking.

            FLL introduces elementary and middle school students to the challenges of real world engineering by having them build a LEGO Mindstorm robot and program the robot to complete tasks, with help from their coaches. Students learn team-building, presentation skills and how to apply math and science concepts to real world problems which all contribute to understanding how to make positive contributions to their community.
