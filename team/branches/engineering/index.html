        This branch is in charge of <i>designing, fabricating, programing and driving</i> our competition robot, 
        along with other mechanical projects created throughout the year. They take the lead in the education of rookies 
        about robotics. At SDA we are blessed with a fully functioning, industrial grade <b>metal and wood shop</b>, 
        the last in our district, where we are given the unique ability to fabricate our robots. To share this opportunity 
        with other FRC teams, we offer <b>open shop hours</b> during build season. Teams can come in, have parts 
        manufactured and learn about the tools we use. Check out all of our robots under the Robots tab.
