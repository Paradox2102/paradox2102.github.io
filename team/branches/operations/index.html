    <h2>Operations</h2>
     <p> Operations handles sponsor relations, business management, and award submissions. In sponsor relations, by initiating and maintaining contact with our sponsors, 
        we are able to keep them updated and involved with what is going on in our team. Business management includes travel arrangements, school relations, and managing 
        our  $60,000 budget. Lastly, Operations takes care of FIRST award submissions, which we start preparing in late summer and submit in mid-February.

        <h3>Sponsor Relations</h3>
       In order to function and grow we rely heavily on the support of our gracious sponsors. Every year, we work to increase our network of sponsors and strengthen our current 
         connections by writing letters of intent, grant proposals, and updates on how our team has performed with their help. Grant writing is a difficult process, so in order to 
         ease the challenge we have a dedicated group of students that attend classes with Grant Writing Associates for six weeks over summer. These six week classes help us identify 
         possible sponsors and learn how to best approach them all the while teaching the fundamental skills of successful grant writing. 
        To show our supporters how much they mean to us, we host a Sponsor Appreciation Night in May. At this event we presents the team’s accomplishments, demonstrates our robot, 
        and gives sponsors a personal tour of our facilities. We also treat them to dinner that is prepared by the team and students in our school’s Culinary Arts Club. This event 
        helps us make personal connections with our sponsors and show them first hand what they have helped us accomplish.
        Additionally, we send Team Updates, Weekly Build season update videos, and invitations to events. 
        See all of our Sponsors under our Sponsors Tab.
