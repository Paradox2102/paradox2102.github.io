# Our Mission

##### “Team Paradox aims to provide an outlet for students of all ages to discover and explore their passions for science, technology, engineering, art, and math (“STEAM”), by maintaining a student-run, community-supported FIRST Robotics team at San Dieguito High School Academy (SDA).” -- *Team Paradox Mission Statement from 2015-2016 Business Plan*

This latest mission statement sums up in one sentence the large sprectrum that this team encoupasses. What makes us special is that we are a **student run team**. All the *writing, artwork, projects, events and much more* that the team produces, the students make happen. However, we would not be here if it wasn’t for the continuous support from our mentors, parent volunteers and, of course, the SDA faculty. 

As far as FRC teams go we’re pretty old, starting up in the 2007 season and running since. Throughout our teams history generations of student leaders have been stretching their skills sets and passing them down to future student leaders. This growing collection of skills and knowledge allows our team to continuously diversify and expand upon our educational experience. There is a notch for all skills in this team, from computer design and machining to photoshop and writing. Once more we work to make this team an environment of learning, through our different programs like Geared Learning or simply working one-on-one with experienced mentors in the field. We recognize the time commitment that members put into this team and work to make every moment valuable. 

*We’re not just nerds with dangerous power tools*- everything we do get’s it’s drive form the enthusiasm of the students. Whatever you're interested in we will recognize and encourage that drive and always put the **Passion FIRST**. That’s the spirit of the team. It’s just who we are.

## How we work: Team Branches

As previously stated we are an FRC FIRST robotics team and at SDA we are one of the clubs, however, we function more as a small business being registered as a 501c3 non profit with the state of California.

We are broken into 4 different branches. 

### Engineering
This branch is in charge of *designing, fabricating, programing and driving* our competition robot, along with other mechanical project created throughout the year. They take the head in educating rookies aspects of robotics. 

At SDA we are blessed with fully functioning, industrial grade **metal and wood shop**, the last in our district, where we are given the unique ability to fabricate our robots. To open this opportunity up to other FRC team we offer **open shop hours** during build season where teams can come in, have parts manufactured and learn about the tools we use. Check out all of our robots under the Robots tab.

### Marketing
Putting the A in STEAM. Marketing is in charge of our teams **image**. This includes making original T-Shirt, jacket and button designs new each year. They also manufacture these products, using our button press and SDA’s screen printing shop to print our T-shirts and jackets. You can find the fruits of these efforts for sale on the Merchandise tab. 

This branch is also in charge of our FLL support program. We mentor teams each year to prepare them for their competition along with putting on two official FLL qualifying tournaments at our school. Find out more about FLL under the FLL tab.

### Outreach
The Outreach branch is in charge of making sure **all events** the team does out in the community are coordinated pulled together and accomplished. This includes yearly events along with finding new events to attend. Also they are in charge of all press releases in any form of media including TV airs and running this website. Find upcomming events under the schedule tab and articles on recent ones on the Home page.

### Opportations
The Operations branch is in charge of the **business administration** for the team. This includes the daunting tasks of scheduling *travel plans, writing grants, sponsor relations, school relations, registration and team member management*. On top of this they also handle our teams submission for FIRST **awards**. Check out past award submissions under the Archives tab then Award submissions and our amazing sponsors under the Sponsor tab.
