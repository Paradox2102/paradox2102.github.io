        The Outreach branch is in charge of making sure <b>all events</b> the team does out in the community are coordinated, 
        pulled together, and accomplished. This includes yearly events along with finding new events to attend. Outreach is also
        in charge of all press releases in any form of media- including TV airs and running this website. Find upcoming events 
        under the Schedule tab and articles about recent events on the home page.
