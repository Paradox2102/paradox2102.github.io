<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<div class="centered">
    “Team Paradox aims to provide an outlet for students of all ages to discover and explore their passions for science, technology, engineering, art, and math (“STEAM”), by maintaining a student-run, community-supported FIRST Robotics team at San Dieguito
    High School Academy (SDA).”

    <p>-<i>Team Paradox Mission Statement from 2015-2016 Business Plan</i></p>
</div>
<div class="jumbotron">
    <p>
    This latest mission statement sums up in one sentence the large spectrum that this team encompasses. What makes us special is that we are a <b>student run team</b>. All the <i>writing, artwork, projects, events and much more</i> that the team produces,
    the students make happen. However, we would not be here if it wasn’t for the continuous support from our mentors, parent volunteers and, of course, the SDA faculty. As far as FRC teams go we’re pretty old, starting up in the 2007 season and running
    since. Throughout our teams history generations of student leaders have been stretching their skills sets and passing them down to future student leaders. This growing collection of skills and knowledge allows our team to continuously diversify and
    expand upon our educational experience. There is a notch for all skills in this team, from computer design and machining to photoshop and writing. Once more we work to make this team an environment of learning, through our different programs like
    Geared Learning or simply working one-on-one with experienced mentors in the field. We recognize the time commitment that members put into this team and work to make every moment valuable.
    </p>
    <br>

    <i>We’re not just nerds with dangerous power tools</i>- everything we do gets its drive form the enthusiasm of the students. Whatever you're interested in we will recognize and encourage that drive and always put the <b>Passion FIRST</b>. That’s
    the spirit of the team. It’s just who we are.

    <h2>How we work: Team Branches</h2></div>
As previously stated we are an FRC FIRST robotics team and at SDA we are one of the clubs, however, we function more as a small business.
We are broken into 4 different branches.

                <h3><a href="/team/branches/engineering/">Engineering</a></h3></div>
            This branch is in charge of <i>designing, fabricating, programing and driving</i> our competition robot, along with other mechanical projects created throughout the year. They take the lead in the education of rookies about robotics. At SDA
            we are blessed with a fully functioning, industrial grade <b>metal and wood shop</b>, the last in our district, where we are given the unique ability to fabricate our robots. To share this opportunity with other FRC teams, we offer <b>open shop hours</b>            during build season. Teams can come in, have parts manufactured and learn about the tools we use. Check out all of our robots under the Robots tab.

            Putting the A in STEAM. Marketing is in charge of our team’s <b>image.</b> This includes making original tee shirts, jacket and button designs each year. They manufacture these products, using our button press and SDA’s screen printing shop
            for the T-shirts and jackets. You can find the fruits of these efforts for sale on the Merchandise tab. This branch is also in charge of our FLL support program. We mentor teams each year to prepare them for their competition along with putting
            on two official FLL qualifying tournaments at our school. Find out more about FLL under the FLL tab.

<h2>How to join Team Paradox</h2>
Everyone is welcome and anyone can help! 
If you think you're interested in becoming a part of the Team Paradox family check out the information below. 
<h3>Student-</h3>
<h4>Make contact:</h4>
<p>We are a year round team and you can join at any time, However, the official FIRST registration window to be on the team starts at the beginning of the school year and continues into October, at the latest. 
The easiest way for an SDA student to learn about the team is to start coming to our Monday meetings which start within the first few weeks of school. You can also sign up on our email list at Back to School Night, the Club Fair or in the Spring earlier at School Choice Night. If you want to start participating sooner, or are a student from another high school looking for a team, reach out to us through our media pages or contact us directly using the links on our Contact Us page. 
</p>
<h4>Get Registered:</h4>
<p>Registration paperwork is passed out at our All Team Meeting which happens in the middle of September. There you will be given physical paperwork that can be turned in at the Monday Meetings and given instructions on how to sign up for STIMS. STIMS is how FIRST recognizes you as an official member of the team. Our team requires you complete a metal shop training with Mr. Berend, our ship teacher. Then a shop safety test is given after school (or during school upon special request) by Mr. Berend. When all of these requirements are completed you are an official part of Team Paradox!</p>
