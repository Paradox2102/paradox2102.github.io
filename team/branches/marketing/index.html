        Putting the A in STEAM. Marketing is in charge of our team’s <b>image.</b> This includes making original tee shirts, 
        jacket and button designs each year. They manufacture these products, using our button press and SDA’s screen 
        printing shop for the T-shirts and jackets. You can find the fruits of these efforts for sale on the Merchandise tab. 
        This branch is also in charge of our FLL support program. We mentor teams each year to prepare them for their competition 
        along with putting on two official FLL qualifying tournaments at our school. Find out more about FLL under the FLL tab.
