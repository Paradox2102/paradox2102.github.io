                    In this year's game you needed to build a robot that stacked tots (storage containers) and put a recycle bin on top of it for a multiple of points. Putting a litter (pool noodle) in the trash can then stacking it on a stack of tots also give an added multiple of points. This year robot alliances had no physical robot interaction and were not directly competing but trying to get the highest score to boost their match average points which determined their ranking.

                    Big Red brought us up to fourth seed in both the Madera and San Diego regional where we we on the 2nd seed alliance and captains of the 3rd seed alliance respectively. In Madera we made it to the finals while is San Diego we got into the semifinals and our robot won the Quality Award. This robot gave us by far our best performance in years.

                	Terrence performed very admirably. All team members were surprised by the lack of activity in the pits. No drive train was replaced, the tower did not crack into two, and with the exception of the occasional lost nut, the robot held together. We still lack slightly in speed of tube delivery, but make up for it in maneuverability.

                	Rinzler is the second component of the main robot, a mini-robot designed and built to play LOGOMOTION. The mini-bot has to deploy in the final ten seconds of the match, climb a ten foot pole, and trigger a pressure plate. The strategy in its design was that reliability in deployment was just as important as the speed of climbing the tower.

                	Between its considerable speed and reliable deployment system, Rinzler was able to make more first place runs in the qualifying rounds than any mini-bot at the competition. With the exception of a few minor bumps and scratches there were no complications with the performance.

We designed a robot that could suck in the soccer balls, maneuver freely using Mecanum drive wheels, kick the soccer balls the distance of the field, and raise up onto the alliance tower.

                	Our game strategy emphasized maneuverability utilizing a modified swerve “skid” drive-train. The drive-train had front and back steering, with left and right drive. The driver had the option of several different control methods to best fit the current match situation. With a rotating turret and vertical holding chute, this robot was designed to get the “moon rocks” quickly from the ground to the opponents.

In the end, we accomplished this, but did not take into effect how important speed would be in the final game. Another thing we failed to think about was that although the higher legs are harder to get to, they are still worth the same amount of points, making them really not worth the effort.

                	The performance in the competition was exactly as we had expected, the four drive wheels arranged around the mast gave us huge maneuverability, and made us a formidable defensive robot. However, the carriage moved up and down the mast painfully slow, and the casters made it easy to push us around. The mast also made us top heavy, and easy to knock over.
