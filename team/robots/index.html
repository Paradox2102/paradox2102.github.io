                    <p class="text-muted">FIRST FRC games vary every year, however, some aspects are more or less consistent. Each team (like us) builds one robot. At competitions 3 teams form an alliance that competes against another alliance. Alliance partners change in each round of play. After each team plays at least 10 matches in the qualification rounds, the teams are ranked according to the number of points scored and the top eight teams are seeded, and will serve as alliance captains for the final matches. Alliance captains choose two other teams to join their alliance for the remainder of the matches throughout the playoff. It is possible to not be a seeded team but become an alliance captain if a higher seeded teams selects another seeded team for their alliance.&nbsp;</p>

                    In this year's game, teams needed to build a robot that stacked totes (storage containers) and put a recycle bin on top of it for a multiple of points. Putting litter (pool noodle) in the trash can and then stacking it on a stack of totes also gave an added multiple of points. This year robot alliances had no physical robot interaction and were not directly competing but trying to get the highest score to boost their match average points to determine their ranking.

                    Gil brought us up to fourth seed in both the Madera and San Diego regional where we won the 2nd seed alliance and were captains of the 3rd seed alliance respectively. In Madera, we made it to the finals, while is San Diego we got into the semifinals. Our robot won the Quality Award and gave us the best performance we've ever had.

                    In Aerial Assist standard alliances competed against each other to score 2 foot in diameter exercise balls into goals on the opposite side of the field. Robots alliances could score extra points by passing the balls to other robots on their alliance and shooting the ball over the bar “truss” in the center of the field.

                    Terrence performed very admirably. All team members were surprised by the lack of activity in the pits. No drive train was replaced, the tower did not crack into two, and with the exception of the occasional lost nut, the robot held together. We still lack slightly in speed of tube delivery, but make up for it in maneuverability.

                    Rinzler is the second component of the main robot, a mini-robot designed and built to play LOGOMOTION. The mini-bot has to deploy in the final ten seconds of the match, climb a ten foot pole, and trigger a pressure plate. The strategy in its design was that reliability in deployment was just as important as the speed of climbing the tower.

                    Between its considerable speed and reliable deployment system, Rinzler was able to make more first place runs in the qualifying rounds than any mini-bot at the competition. With the exception of a few minor bumps and scratches there were no complications with the performance.

                    This was the lets do everything and beat everyone robot. Our game strategy was naïve and over-ambitious. We designed a robot that could suck in the soccer balls, maneuver freely using Mecanum drive wheels, kick the soccer balls the distance of the field, and raise up onto the alliance tower.

                    In our initial design, we stressed the ability to reach all three levels of racks, and high maneuverability. In the end, we accomplished this, but did not take into effect how important speed would be in the final game. Another thing we failed to think about was that although the higher legs are harder to get to, they are still worth the same amount of points, making them really not worth the effort.

                    The performance in the competition was exactly as we had expected, the four drive wheels arranged around the mast gave us huge maneuverability, and made us a formidable defensive robot. However, the carriage moved up and down the mast painfully slow, and the casters made it easy to push us around. The mast also made us top heavy, and easy to knock over.
