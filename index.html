    <h2>
    Welcome to SDA Robotics: Team Paradox!
    </h2>
    <p>We are <strong>engineers</strong>, <strong>artists</strong>, <strong>machinists</strong>, <strong>managers</strong>, <strong>programmers</strong>, <strong>writers</strong>, <strong>makers</strong>, and <strong>problem solvers</strong>. Our family has grown from a team of 2 students in 2006 to 55 students, 20 mentors and countless parents and supporters. However our purpose has been ever lasting throughout the generations.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>
    We’re a bunch of teenagers, who somehow have time to spare and we’re going to solve a problem.
    </h4>
    <p>
    Supporting <strong>STEAM</strong> <em>(science technology, engineering, art and math)</em> education we strive to provide an environment for people of all ages to discover their passion. Starting out from the platform of FIRST (for the inspiration and recognition of science and technology) FRC (FIRST robotics competition) our team has become so much more than just finishing a robot by the end of build season. Using FIRST as a base, we strive to expand on the values of FIRST and find something within the team to make our own personal mission. Whether that’s finishing the competition robot in time to program an autonomous, starting a new FLL team or hosting our own STEAM fair, we push ourselves to be imaginative, innovative and adventurous.
    We at FIRST Team Paradox 2102 have dedicated ourselves to making and becoming the next generation of problem solvers.
    </p>

    And well this is our website. Here you can find out everything about our team with a little reading and a lot of pretty pictures. If you're new to FIRST or STEAM check out our quick information page on them. This page also gives you the definitions of the uncommon words or special/specific usages of words we use commonly on this site.
    If you have any questions, comments, or concerns feel free to contact us by the contacts placed on our contacts tab.
