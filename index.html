    <h2>
    Welcome to SDA Robotics: Team Paradox!
    </h2>
    <p>
        We at <strong>FIRST Team Paradox 2102</strong> have dedicated ourselves to becoming and guiding the next generation of problem solvers. With <em>engineers, artists, machinists, managers, programmers, writers, makers and much more</em> within our ranks we work to find the kinds of creative solutions that are necessary in our world. Our family has grown from a team of two students in 2006 to 55 high school students, 20 mentors and countless parents and supporters. Throughout all these years, each generation has maintained the mission of giving students a hands on opportunity to solve real world problems in a supportive, creative, challenging and most of all fun setting. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Supporting <strong>STEAM</strong> <em>(science technology, engineering, art and math)</em> education, we strive to provide an environment for students of all ages to discover their passion. Starting from the platform of <strong>FIRST</strong> <em>(For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology)</em>, specifically the <strong>FRC</strong> <em>(FIRST Robotics Competition)</em> division, our team does so much more than finish a robot in six weeks. Expanding on FIRST's core values, each individual finds an aspect of the team where their skills are needed and strengthen the group. Whether that is building a grade robot, writing the code to make it move, starting a new FLL team, hosting our own STEAM fair, or managing the team for a successful year, we push ourselves to be imaginative, innovative and adventurous. 
    </p>
