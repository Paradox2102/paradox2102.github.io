    <h2>
    Welcome to SDA Robotics: Team Paradox!
    </h2>
    <p>We at <strong>FIRST Team Paradox 2102</strong> have dedicated ourselves to becoming and guiding the next generation of problem solvers. With <em>engineers, artists, machinists, managers, programmers, writers, makers and much more</em> within our ranks we work to find the kinds of creative solutions that are necessary in our world. Our family has grown from a team of two students in 2006 to 55 high school students, 20 mentors and countless parents and supporters. Throughout all these years, each generation has maintained the mission of giving students a hands on opportunity to solve real world problems in a supportive, creative, challenging and most of all fun setting.  
Supporting <strong>STEAM</strong> <em>(science technology, engineering, art and math)</em> education, we strive to provide an environment for students of all ages to discover their passion. Starting from the platform of <strong>FIRST</strong> <em>(For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology)</em>, specifically the <strong>FRC</strong> <em>(FIRST Robotics Competition)</em> division, our team does so much more than finish a robot in six weeks. Expanding on FIRST's core values, each individual finds an aspect of the team where their skills are needed and strengthen the group. Whether that is building a grade robot, writing the code to make it move, starting a new FLL team, hosting our own STEAM fair, or managing the team for a successful year, we push ourselves to be imaginative, innovative and adventurous. 
	On this website you can discover more about FIRST and how our team works to go above and beyond FIRST’s missions. If you're new to FIRST and/or STEAM, please check out our About: FIRST page to learn more. This page also gives you the definitions of some uncommon or special/specific usages of words on this site. 
If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to contact us through the links on our <strong>Contacts tab</strong>.

    We’re a bunch of teenagers, who somehow have time to spare and we’re going to solve a problem.

    Supporting <strong>STEAM</strong> <em>(science technology, engineering, art and math)</em> education we strive to provide an environment for people of all ages to discover their passion. Starting out from the platform of FIRST (for the inspiration and recognition of science and technology) FRC (FIRST robotics competition) our team has become so much more than just finishing a robot by the end of build season. Using FIRST as a base, we strive to expand on the values of FIRST and find something within the team to make our own personal mission. Whether that’s finishing the competition robot in time to program an autonomous, starting a new FLL team or hosting our own STEAM fair, we push ourselves to be imaginative, innovative and adventurous.
    We at FIRST Team Paradox 2102 have dedicated ourselves to making and becoming the next generation of problem solvers.
